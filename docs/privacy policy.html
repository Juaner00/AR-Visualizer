        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="lead">Effective date: <strong>10/1/2025</strong></p>
        <p class="lead">This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>SERIINCO</strong> ("we", "us", or "our")
            collects, uses, and discloses information when you use the <strong>APP SERIINCO</strong> mobile
            application.</p>
    </header>

    <section>
        <h2>1. Information We Access</h2>
        <p><strong>Camera access:</strong> The app requests the device camera permission
            (<code>android.permission.CAMERA</code>) to provide in-app features that require a live camera feed (for
            example, augmented reality or photo capture).</p>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> access any other personal data unless explicitly requested and disclosed in this
            policy or in-app prompts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. How We Use the Camera</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The camera feed is used only in real-time inside the app to support features described in the app
                interface.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> store, record, or upload camera images or video to our servers unless you
                explicitly choose an action that saves or shares media (for example, if you press a "save" or "share"
                button).</li>
            <li>If you save or share media, those files are handled according to the app's UI choices and any additional
                permissions you grant.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
        <p>We do not sell or share personal data collected through the camera with third parties for their own purposes.
            If the app integrates third-party SDKs that require camera access, we will disclose that in-app or in this
            policy and those SDKs will be governed by their own privacy policies.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Data Retention & Security</h2>
        <p>If the app stores any images or media locally (because you explicitly saved them), those files remain on your
            device and are controlled by your device’s file-management and privacy settings. We take reasonable measures
            to protect data, but no method of transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Children</h2>
        <p>Our app is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children
            under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, contact us and we will
            take steps to delete such information.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights under local privacy laws (for example, access, correction,
            deletion, or portability). To exercise these rights, contact us using the information below.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will update the "Effective date" at the
            top. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>
